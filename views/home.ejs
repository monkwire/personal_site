    <p>Hi! My name is Clide and I am a software developer based in NYC. I graduated from the University of Texas with a B.A. in government. I am passionate about coding, writing, and open-source software.</p>
    <p>Some of my non-programming interests include puzzles, board games, and music.</p>
    <p>I made this site using Express, Node.js, ejs, HTML, CSS, and JS. All art on this site is my own. All code is publicly available at <a href="//www.github.com/monkwire">github.com/monkwire</a>.</p>
